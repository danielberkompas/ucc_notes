# The Nature of Liability

## Four Questions

1. What "negotiable instrument" labels apply to the parties?
    a. **Drawer**: One who writes a draft.
    b. **Drawee**: The one who is ordered to honor the draft. (Bank)
    c. **Payee**: The third party who is to be paid on the draft or note.
    d. **Maker**: One who makes a note.
    e. **Indorser**: A holder of a note who indorses it and then transfers it to another party. (Such as his bank)
    f. **Guarantor**: One responsible to "back up" the promises contained in a note or draft.
2. What causes of actions are available to each party?
3. What defenses are possible?
4. Is anyone else liable?

## Notes
Begin as two-party instruments, *maker* and *payee*.  If the payee signs the instrument, they become an *indorser*.

## Drafts
Begin as three-party instruments.  For example, a check.  Owner of check is *drawer*, bank is *drawee* and the person being paid is the *payee*.

## Three Possible Legal Theories
1. Contract
2. Warranty (Property)
3. Conversion (Tort)

## Indorsers
Anyone who signs a note/draft in an ambiguous capacity is *presumed* to assume the liability.  However, this obligation is *secondary*.  There are three steps that must take place before an indorser can be called upon to pay:

1. **Presentment**. The bill must have been presented to the *maker* first.
2. **Dishonor**. The bill must have been dishonored by the maker.
3. **Notice of Dishonor.** In certain circumstances, the *indorser* must have notice that the maker dishonored the note or draft.

(Essentially, an indorser is not liable "until the person primarily liable has dishonored the instrument and the indorser has been so notified.")
