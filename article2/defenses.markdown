# Defenses (UCC)

## Unconscionability - [ยง2-302][2-302]
If the clauses in a contract are "so onesided as to be unconscionable under the circumstances existing at the time of making the contract", the court may consider the terms unconscionable.  However, this is unlikely since courts rarely consider whether consideration was sufficient.

If a court does find that terms of the contract are unconscionable, it is free to void the entire contract, or apply the contract excepting the clause.

### Notes
- Much more likely in consumer cases, since business people are presumed to know what they are contracting for.
