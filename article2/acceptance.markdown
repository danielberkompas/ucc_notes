# Acceptance (UCC) - [§2-206][2-206]

A buyer may **accept goods** under the UCC in three main ways. See [§2-206][2-206].

1. After a reasonable opportunity to inspect, tell the seller that the goods are conforming, or that he'll keep the goods anyway.
2. Fail to reject the goods, after a reasonable opportunity to inspect.
3. Act inconsistently with the seller's ownership.

## Manner of Acceptance
According to [§2-206][2-206], an offer may be accepted in any reasonable medium *unless the seller expressly provides otherwise.* 

> Unless otherwise unambiguously indicated by the language or circumstances (a) an offer to make a contract shall be construed as inviting acceptance in any manner and by any medium reasonable in the circumstances.

- [UCC §2-206(1)(a)][2-206] 

## Counteroffers
Under the common law, an acceptance that varied the terms of the contract in *any* way was considered a **counteroffer**, not an acceptance.

However, the UCC is more lenient.  A non-conforming shipment of goods will be *both* an acceptance and a *breach* of the contract, unless the seller notifies the buyer that the non-conforming goods are being sent as an accommodation. In that case, the shipment would be a counteroffer which the buyer would be free to reject outright with no liability.

> [A]n order or other offer to buy goods for prompt or current shipment shall be construed as inviting acceptance either by a prompt promise to ship or by the prompt or current shipment of conforming or nonconforming goods, but the shipment of nonconforming goods is not an acceptance if the seller seasonably notifies the buyer that the shipment is offered only as an accommodation to the buyer.

- [UCC §2-206(1)(b)][2-206]

## Additional/Different Terms (Battle of the Forms)
In business, it is common for the parties to exchange standard forms with differing terms.  It is therefore important to determine which terms became part of the contract.  The UCC treats contracts between merchants and non-merchants differently in this area.

### Between Merchants - [§2-207][2-207]
Between merchants, additional terms *automatically* become part of the contract unless:

- The new terms are a **material alteration**.
- Offer was **expressly limited** to the terms therein.
- The **offeror objects** to the new terms within a *reasonable time*.

Note that the parties don't have to be merchants in the same type of business.

### Where One Party is a Non-Merchant
The UCC will apply common law rules. Therefore, when one of the parties is a non-merchant, an acceptance may not contain any new terms.

## Rejection
According to [§2-601][2-601], a buyer may only accept or reject "any commercial unit or units" of the shipment.  He cannot reject only part of a "unit", but must reject the whole commercial unit.

After a buyer rejects goods, he is obligated to hold them with "reasonable care" and follow the seller's instructions as to removal.  The goods must be held for a reasonable time until the seller can remove them.  If the goods are perishable, they may be sold by the buyer on the seller's account. (i.e., the buyer must give the proceeds to the seller, and not keep them for himself)

## Definiteness
The Common Law has stringent rules on definiteness for contracts.  The UCC significantly lightens these, and only requires the following to be clear:

- The type of good
- Quantity

All other terms can be filled in with terms that are reasonable under the circumstances.

## Other Important Notes
- Silence can constitute acceptance under the UCC. (Not under common law.)  The buyer can either:
		- Fail to effectively reject the shipment
		- Or act inconsistently with the seller's continued ownership, such as by reselling the goods.
- Since the manner of acceptance only has to be *reasonable*, the offeree can bind the offeror pretty easily, such as simply by shipping the goods or a prompt promise to ship. (ex. Amazon order confirmation email)
- If non-conforming goods are shipped, the buyer has an action for damages unless the seller makes it clear that this is only an accommodation.  The non-conforming goods were an acceptance *and* breach of the contract.
- The Amended UCC allows for electronic agents to form contracts without human interaction. (For example, automated stock trading, inventory systems)
