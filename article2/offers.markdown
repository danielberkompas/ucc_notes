## ยง2-205 Merchant Firm Offer Rule
The UCC changes the Common Law in one major way, by adding the merchant firm offer rule.  This allows [merchants][definitions] to make irrevocable offers without consideration. 

> An offer by a merchant to buy or sell goods in a signed record that by its terms gives assurance that it will be held open is not revocable, for lack of consideration, during the time stated or if no time is stated for a reasonable time, but in no event may such period of irrevocability exceed three months; but in no event may the period of irrevocability exceed three months. Any such term of assurance in a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the offeror.

- [UCC ยง2-205](http://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/article2.htm#s2-205)

The requirements are:

- The offeror must be a [merchant][definitions].
- Writing **signed** by the offeror.
- Gives assurance that it will be held open.

The offer will be held open for:

1. The time stated. OR
2. A reasonable time. 
3. Not exceeding 3 months.  Offers purporting to stay open for more than 3 months will only be held open for 3 months.
