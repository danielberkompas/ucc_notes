# Article 2

Article 2 to do with Sales &amp; Leases of **goods**.

## Scope of UCC Authority
The UCC overrides the common law in sales of goods.  However, it does not replace the common law, which will apply to any situation which the code does not speak to.

The UCC does not apply to *service* contracts.  In mixed cases, there are two tests:

- **Predominant Factor/Purpose Test.** If the contract was *predominantly* for services, the common law applies, and vice versa.
- **Gravamen of the Injury Test.** (Minority) If the harm sued for primarily had to do with a service, the common law will be applied; if the harm had to to with goods, the UCC will be applied.

## General Definitions

- **Goods**. Any item which is both *identifiable* and *moveable* at the time the contract is made. See [§2-105][2-105] and [§2-107][2-107].
    - Specially manufactured goods
    - Unborn young of animals
    - Growing crops
    - Crops and fixtures that can be removed without material harm to the land, and timber.
    - Minerals, and structures to be removed from land by the seller, not the buyer.
- **Merchant**. One who regularly deals in goods of the kind, or otherwise holds himself out as having knowledge or experience peculiar to the sale of the good in the contract. [§2-104(1)][2-104]
- **Sale**. Any transaction or contract by which seller transfers *title* to goods to the buyer, for a price.
- **Good Faith**. "Honesty in fact in the conduct or transaction incurred." [§1-203][1-203]
    - Merchants have an additional duty: "observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade." [§2-103(1)(b)][2-103]
    - This has changed under the Amended UCC. Both merchants and non-merchants have the same duty.
- **Record**. Information that is inscribed on a tangible medium or that is stored in an electronic or other medium and is retrievable in perceivable form. [§1-201][1-201]

## Shipment Terms
See [§2-319][2-319].

These terms are somewhat confusing and important to understand.

- **Freight on Board. (F.O.B)**
- **Free Alongside. (F.A.S)**
- **(C.O.D)**
