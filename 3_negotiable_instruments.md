# Negotiable Instruments
Governed by U.C.C. [Article 3](http://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/3/) and [Article 4](http://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/4/).

## Types
There are two basic types of negotiable instrument covered by Article 3, _notes_ and _drafts_.

### Notes
A note is a written promise to pay money. If created by a bank, it's called a **certificate of deposit**, or "CD" for short.

### Drafts
A draft is a written order on another, directing him to pay money to a third person. (Most checks would fall under this category)

Examples:
> John: I hereby authorize Bank to pay Suzie $100.  
> Check: Payable to <u>Recipient</u>

#### Terminology
People involved in drafts are given various different names.

* **Drawer**: The person making the draft. (Owner of the account)
* **Drawee**: The entity that's supposed to honor the draft. (Bank)
* **Payee**: The person/entity that is being paid. (3rd party)
