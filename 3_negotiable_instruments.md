# Negotiable Instruments
Governed by U.C.C. [Article 3][a-3] and [Article 4][a-4].

## Types
There are two basic types of negotiable instrument covered by Article 3, _notes_ and _drafts_.

### Notes
A note is a written promise to pay money. If created by a bank, it's called a **certificate of deposit**, or "CD" for short.

### Drafts
A draft is a written order on another, directing him to pay money to a third person. (Most checks would fall under this category)

Examples:
> John: I hereby authorize Bank to pay Suzie $100.  
> Check: Payable to <u>Recipient</u>

#### Terminology
People involved in drafts are given various different names.

* **Drawer**: The person making the draft. (Owner of the account)
* **Drawee**: The entity that's supposed to honor the draft. (Bank)
* **Payee**: The person/entity that is being paid. (3rd party)

For a detailed list of the terminology used, see [ยง3-103][a-3#103].

## Negotiability
In order for [Article 3][a-3] to apply, the instrument in question must be _negotiable_.  

If a paper is _nonnegotiable_, it acts only as an assignment of a contract right, subject to all defenses arising from the transaction in question.

If it is _negotiable_, the original maker will have to pay it at maturity despite any defenses they might have.

### ยง3-104(a) [[link][a-3#104]] Requirements
> (a) Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d), "negotiable instrument" means an unconditional promise or order to pay a fixed amount of money, with or without interest or other charges described in the promise or order, if it:  
> 
> (1) is payable to bearer or to order at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder;  
> 
> (2) is payable on demand or at a definite time; and  
> 
> (3) does not state any other undertaking or instruction by the person promising or ordering payment to do any act in addition to the payment of money, but the promise or order may contain (i) an undertaking or power to give, maintain, or protect collateral to secure payment, (ii) an authorization or power to the holder to confess judgment or realize on or dispose of collateral, or (iii) a waiver of the benefit of any law intended for the advantage or protection of an obligor. 

### Summary
The instrument must be:

1. In writing
2. Signed
3. An **unconditional** promise to pay/order to pay. (Free from _express_ conditions on payment)
